# Project Shape Function.
##  The Goal of this project is to build a library of General Shape Functions of all orders possible for Elements such as Lines, Triangles, Quadrilaterals, Tetrahedrals, Hexahedrals, Prisms and Pyramids. Basically every kind of Element that is possible to be generated by Gmsh.

## This project shall be later ported to C++ and be integrated into Project-FEA2.

### As of now the following Elements are ready
#### Complete Triangles

### The following Shape Functions are still to be built.
#### Incomplete Triangles
#### Complete & Incomplete Quadrilaterals
#### Tetrahedrals
#### Hexahedrals
#### Prisms
#### Pyramids
